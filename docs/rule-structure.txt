Rule Structure

All rules can be used as a node-express middleware,
Just, create your own custom rule in "rules" folder (postfix "-rule" is mandatory).
and implement your check function. This function receive two argument, "user" and "data".
user filled by framework (by JWT token), and data is an optional parameter that use can pass it while use it as middleware.
When you define your custom rule, you shoud import "core/helpers/rule-helper" module in your route file and call "can" function as a middleware of route by passign rule filename (and subfolders shoud be separated by "." sign).

Pay attension to example ;)

redis-route.js
    const Rule = use('core/helpers/rule-helper");

    Router.get('/redis/test', [
        Rule('redis.rule1),
        function(req, res, next){
            res.end(200);
        }
    ]);

In folder "rules/redis", file "rule1-rule.js"
    'use strict';

    /**
    * Rule
    */
    function Rule() {}
    module.exports = Rule;

    /**
    * Check data
    */
    Rule.check = function check(user, data) {
        Logger.debug("This is a test rule for redis route, it return true");
        
        return true;
    };
